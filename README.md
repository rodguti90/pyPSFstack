# pyPSFstack

Python library for the numerical modelling of PSF stacks used to 
characterize single molecule fluorescence microscope.

## What is it?

pyPSFstack is a simple module that allows computing the stacks of 
point spread functions (PSFs) generated by single emitters on a 
microscope. It is based on the vectorial model and can model coherent 
or incoherent sources. It also provides three kinds of stack: defocus, 
polarization, and distance to the coverslip. Lastly, it can also 
model the blurring effect due to the size of the source which
is of particular importance when characterizing a setup with 
fluorescent nano-beads.
